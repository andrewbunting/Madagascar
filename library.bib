Our new approach to locating convective boundaries is consistent with the physics of convection, and yields reliable values of the convective core mass during both hydrogen and helium burning phases. Stars with {\$}M{\textless}8\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} become white dwarfs and cool to the point where the electrons are degenerate and the ions are strongly coupled, a realm now available to study with MESA due to improved treatments of element diffusion, latent heat release, and blending of equations of state. Studies of the final fates of massive stars are extended in MESA by our addition of an approximate Riemann solver that captures shocks and conserves energy to high accuracy during dynamic epochs. We also introduce a 1D capability for modeling the effects of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that, in combination with the coupling to a public version of the STELLA radiation transfer instrument, creates new avenues for exploring Type II supernovae properties. These capabilities are exhibited with exploratory models of pair-instability supernova, pulsational pair-instability supernova, and the formation of stellar mass black holes. The applicability of MESA is now widened by the capability of importing multi-dimensional hydrodynamic models into MESA. We close by introducing software modules for handling floating point exceptions and stellar model optimization, and four new software tools -- MESAWeb, MESA-Docker, pyMESA, and mesastar.org -- to enhance MESA's education and research impact.},

These recommendations synthesize inspiration from our own work, from the experiences of the thousands of people who have taken part in Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops over the past six years, and from a variety of other guides. Our recommendations are aimed specifically at people who are new to research computing. Author Summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, they take days or weeks to do things that could be done in minutes or hours, are often unable to reproduce their own work (much less the work of others), and have no idea how reliable their computational results are. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt regardless of their current level of technical skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources, from our daily lives, and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

abstract = {Hundreds of substellar companions to solar-type stars will be discovered with the Kepler satellite. Kepler's ex-treme photometric precision gives access to low-amplitude stellar variability contributed by a variety of physical processes. We discuss in detail the periodic flux modulations arising from the tidal force on the star due to a substellar companion. An analytic expression for the variability is derived in the equilibrium-tide approximation. We demonstrate analytically and through numerical solutions of the linear, nonadiabatic stellar oscillation equations that the equilibrium-tide formula works extremely well for stars of mass {\textless}1.4 M with thick surface convection zones. More massive stars with largely radiative envelopes do not conform to the equilibrium-tide approximation and can exhibit flux variations k10 times larger than naive estimates. Over the full range of stellar masses considered, we treat the oscillatory response of the convection zone by adapting a prescription that A. J. Brickhill developed for pulsating white dwarfs. Compared to other sources of periodic variability, the ellipsoidal light curve has a distinct dependence on time and system parameters. We suggest that ellipsoidal oscillations induced by giant planets may be detectable from as many as {\$}100 of the 10 5 Kepler target stars. For the subset of these stars that show transits and have radial-velocity measurements, all system parameters are well constrained, and measurement of ellipsoidal variation pro-vides a consistency check, as well as a test of the theory of forced stellar oscillations in a challenging regime.},

To make our method useful for current and future space missions such as K2, TESS and PLATO, we train classifiers that are able to classify the evolutionary states of lower frequency resolution spectra expected from these mis-sions. Additionally, we provide new classifications for 8633 Kepler red giants, out of which 426 have previously not been classified using asteroseismology. This brings the total to 14983 Kepler red giants classified with our new neural network.

abstract = {Subject headings: Planets and satellites: detection – surveys – catalogs – binaries: eclipsing Photometric survey data from the Kepler (Koch, et al. 2010) mission have been used to discover and characterize thousands of transiting exoplanet and eclipsing binary (EB) systems. These discoveries have enabled empirical studies of occurrence rates 1 which reveal that exoplanets are ubiquitous and found in a wide variety of system architectures and physical compositions. Because the detection strategy of Kepler is most sensitive to short orbital periods, the vast majority of these objects reside within 1 AU of their host star. Although other detection techniques have successfully identified exoplanets at wider orbits beyond the snow lines of their respective host stars (e.g., radial velocity, microlensing, direct imaging), occurrence rates within this population remain poorly constrained. As such, identifying long period objects (LPOs) from archival Kepler and K2 (Howell, et al. 2014) data is valuable from both a statistical and theoretical standpoint, particularly for massive gas giants which are thought to heavily influence the formation and evolution dynamics of their respective systems. Here we present a catalog of 164 single transit and eclipse candidates detected during a comprehensive survey of all currently available K2 data. Identification of LPO candidates from Kepler data has been accomplished in several previous studies, which we briefly summarize here. Wang, et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2015) leveraged a crowd sourcing strategy based on manual inspections performed by citizen-scientists of the Planet Hunters project (Fischer, et al. 2012), identifying 15 double-transit candidates and 17 single-transit candidates. Similarly, Uehara, et al. (2016) performed a visual inspection of 7557 Kepler Objects of Interest which recovered 28 single transits; including 7 objects consistent with Neptune-sized and Jupiter-sized exoplanets. Kipping, et al. (2014) and Kipping et al. (2015) utilized an automated pipeline to identify and validate a Uranus-sized exoplanet orbiting Kepler-421 and a Jupiter-sized exoplanet orbiting Kepler-167. Finally, Foreman-Mackey, et al. (2016) utilized a pipeline equipped with a probabilistic model comparison function to systematically search the light curves of 39,036 G and K dwarfs observed by Kepler, recovering 3 double-transit candidates and 13 single-transit candidates. An important result from the Foreman-Mackey study was to show an estimated occurrence rate for G/K dwarfs of 2.00(+/-0.7) exoplanets smaller than Jupiter in the 2 to 25 year orbital period range.},

abstract = {Spiral density waves dominate several facets of accretion disc dynamics — planet-disc interactions and gravitational instability (GI) most prominently. Though they have been examined thoroughly in two-dimensional simulations, their vertical structures in the non-linear regime are somewhat unexplored. This neglect is unwarranted given that any strong vertical motions associated with these waves could profoundly impact dust dynamics, dust sedimentation, planet formation, and the emissivity of the disc surface. In this paper we combine linear calculations and shearing box simulations in order to investigate the vertical structure of spiral waves for various polytropic stratifications and wave amplitudes. For sub-adiabatic profiles we find that spiral waves develop a pair of counter-rotating poloidal rolls. Particularly strong in the nonlinear regime, these vortical structures issue from the baroclinicity supported by the background vertical entropy gradient. They are also intimately connected to the disk's g-modes which appear to interact nonlinearly with the density waves. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the poloidal rolls are ubiquitous in gravitoturbulence, emerging in the vicinity of GI spiral wakes, and potentially transporting grains off the disk midplane. Other than hindering sedimentation and planet formation, this phenomena may bear on observations of the disk's scattered infrared luminosity. The vortical features could also impact on the turbulent dynamo operating in young protoplanetary discs subject to GI, or possibly even galactic discs.},

abstract = {Jupiter played an important role in determining the structure and configuration of the Solar System. Whereas hot-Jupiter type exoplanets preferentially form around metal-rich stars, the conditions re-quired for the formation of planets with masses, orbits and eccentricities comparable to Jupiter (Jupiter analogues) are unknown. Using spectroscopic metallicities, we show that stars hosting Jupiter ana-logues have an average metallicity close to solar, in contrast to their hot-Jupiter and eccentric cool Jupiter counterparts, which orbit stars with super-solar metallicities. Furthermore, the eccentrici-ties of Jupiter analogues increase with host star metallicity, suggesting that planet-planet scatterings producing highly eccentric cool Jupiters could be more common in metal-rich environments. To investigate a possible explanation for these metallicity trends, we compare the observations to nu-merical simulations, which indicate that metal-rich stars typically form multiple Jupiters, leading to planet-planet interactions and, hence, a prevalence of either eccentric cool Jupiters or hot-Jupiters with circularized orbits. Although the samples are small and exhibit variations in their metallicities, suggesting that numerous processes other than metallicity affect the formation of planetary systems, the data in hand suggests that Jupiter analogues and terrestrial-sized planets form around stars with average metallicities close to solar, whereas high metallicity systems preferentially host eccentric cool Jupiter or hot-Jupiters, indicating higher metallicity systems may not be favorable for the formation of planetary systems akin to the Solar System.},

In this letter, we address the physical processes of turbulent convection that are predominantly responsible for the frequency differences between standard models and observations, also called 'surface effects'. We compare measured solar frequencies from the MDI instrument on the SOHO spacecraft with frequency calculations that include three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulation results in the equilibrium model, nonadiabatic effects, and a consistent treatment of the turbu-lent pressure in both the equilibrium and stability computations. With the consistent inclusion of the above physics in our model computation we are able to reproduce the observed solar frequencies to 3µHz without the need of any additional ad-hoc functional corrections.},

abstract = {Recent (2011) results from the Nice Observatory indicate the existence of global seismic modes on Jupiter in the frequency range between 0.7 and 1.5mHz with amplitudes of tens of cm/s. Currently, the driving force behind these modes is a mystery; the measured amplitudes are many orders of magnitude larger than anticipated based on theory analogous to helioseismology (that is, turbulent convection as a source of stochastic excitation). One of the most promising hypotheses is that these modes are driven by Jovian storms. This work constructs a framework to analytically model the expected equilibrium normal mode amplitudes arising from convective columns in storms. We also place rough constraints on Jupiter's seismic modal quality factor. Using this model, neither meteor strikes, turbulent convection, nor water storms can feasibly excite the order of magnitude of observed amplitudes. Next we speculate about the potential role of rock storms deeper in Jupiter's atmosphere, because the rock storms' expected energy scales make them promising candidates to be the chief source of excitation for Jovian seismic modes, based on simple scaling arguments. We also suggest some general trends in the expected partition of energy between different frequency modes. Finally we supply some commentary on potential applications to gravity, Juno, Cassini and Saturn, and future missions to Uranus and Neptune.},

This will usher in an era of comparative planetology that will be limited not by a paucity of targets but by the scarcity of follow-up assets on the ground and in space. It will become crucial to ensure that the selection of targets is matched carefully against the availability and capability of follow-up telescopes. We propose a metric-based target selection approach that relies only on primary transit observables. The metric can be easily deployed within a distributed heterogeneous network of telescopes equipped to undertake either broadband photometry or spectroscopy. We show how the metric can be used either to optimise the observing strategy for a given telescope (eg choice of filter) or to enable the selection of the best telescope to optimise the overall sample size. The metric can also provide the basis for a selection function to help evaluate the statistical completeness of follow-up transmission spectroscopy datasets. Finally, we validate our metric by comparing its ranked set of targets against planets which have had their atmospheres successfully probed. We also compare the target list selected by our metric against some existing prioritised exoplanet lists.},

We find Doppler variability with a period of 2.23 days as well as photometric signals: (1) a short period signal which is similar to the radial velocity signal albeit with considerable variability; and (2) a long term activity cycle of 4070±120 days. We examine the short-term photometric signal in the available ASAS and MOST photometry and find that the signal is not consistently present and varies considerably as a function of time. This signal undergoes a phase change of roughly 0.8 rad when considering the first and second halves of the MOST data set which are separated in median time by 3.38 days. In contrast, the Doppler signal is stable in the combined HARPS and HIRES radial velocities for over 4700 days and does not appear to vary in time in amplitude, phase, period or as a function of extracted wavelength. We consider a variety of star-spot scenarios and find it challenging to simultaneously explain the rapidly varying photometric signal and the stable radial velocity signal as being caused by starspots co-rotating on the stellar surface. This suggests that the origin of the Doppler periodicity might be the gravitational tug of a planet orbiting the star in spin-orbit resonance. For such a scenario and no spin-orbit misalignment, the measured v sin i indicates an inclination angle of 15.5±2.5 deg and a planetary companion mass of 0.237±0.047 M Jup .},

abstract = {Heartbeat stars are eccentric binary stars in short-period orbits whose light curves are shaped by tidal distortion, reflection and Doppler beaming. Some heartbeat stars exhibit tidally excited oscillations and present new opportunities for understanding the physics of tidal dissipation within stars. We present detailed methods to compute the forced amplitudes, frequencies and phases of tidally excited oscillations in eccentric binary systems. Our methods (i) factor out the equilibrium tide for easier comparison with observations, (ii) account for rotation using the traditional approximation, (iii) incorporate non-adiabatic effects to reliably compute surface luminosity perturbations, (iv) allow for spin–orbit misalignment and (v) correctly sum over contributions from many oscillation modes. We also discuss why tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) are more visible in hot stars with surface temperatures T 6500 K, and we derive some basic probability theory that can be used to compare models with data in a statistical manner. Application of this theory to heartbeat systems can be used to determine whether observed TEOs can be explained by chance resonances with stellar oscillation modes, or whether a resonance locking process is operating.},

@article{Robinson1982,
abstract = {Although the ZZ Ceti stars, or pulsating white dwarfs, are usually thought to be pulsating in the nonradial g-modes, this conclusion is based entirely on the observed periods of the pulsations. Very little attention, either theoretical or observational, has been given to the spectral and multicolor variations of the ZZ Ceti stars. Therefore, in the first part of this paper we calculate the theoretical color, radial velocity, and line profile variations of a white dwarf undergoing ¿/-mode pulsations. We find that the luminosity and color variations of the white dwarf are caused by its temperature variations, not by its geometry or gravity variations. We also find that the variations in the profiles and radial velocities of the absorption lines in the spectrum of the white dwarf will be too small to be measured. This lack of variation in the line profiles and velocities should unambiguously distinguish the ¿/-mode pulsations from the r-mode pulsations. In the second part of this paper we report the results of our multicolor photometry of the ZZ Ceti star R548. We find that, to within the observational errors, the luminosity variations of R548 are consistent with temperature variations. Thus, we conclude that the properties of the pulsations of R548 are consistent with the expected properties of ¿/-mode pulsations.},

abstract = {We predict the flux and surface velocity perturbations produced by convectively excited gravity modes (g-modes) in main sequence stars. Core convection in massive stars can excite g-modes to sufficient amplitudes to be detectable with high precision photometry by Kepler and CoRoT, if the thickness of the convective overshoot region is 30 per cent of a pressure scale height. The g-modes manifest as excess photo-metric variability, with amplitudes of ∼ 10 micromagnitudes at frequencies 10 µHz (0.8 d −1) near the solar metallicity zero-age main sequence. The flux variations are largest for stars with M 5 M ⊙ , but are potentially detectable down to M ∼ 2 − 3 M ⊙ . During the main sequence evolution, radiative damping decreases such that ever lower frequency modes reach the stellar surface and flux perturbations reach up to ∼ 100 micromagnitudes at the terminal-age main sequence. Using the same convective excitation model, we confirm previous predictions that solar g-modes produce surface velocity perturbations of 0.3 mm s −1 . This implies that stochastically excited g-modes are more easily detectable in the photometry of massive main sequence stars than in the Sun.},

Most importantly, JWST spectroscopy will investigate planetary atmospheres to determine atomic and molecular compositions, to probe vertical and horizontal structure, and to follow dynamical evolution, i.e. exoplanet weather. JWST will sample a diverse population of planets of varying masses and densities in a wide variety of environments characterized by a range of host star masses and metallicities, orbital semi-major axes and eccentricities.

As such, it maps out over a 15-year horizon the techniques and capabilities required to detect and measure the properties of planets as small as Earth around stars as large as our own Sun. It shows how the technology pieces and their development fit together to achieve the primary goal of the strategy: if planets like Earth exist around stars within some tens of light years of our own Solar System, those planets will be found and their basic properties characterized. Essential to this strategy is not only the search for and examination of individual planets, but also a knowledge of the arrangement, or architecture, of planetary systems around as large a number of stars as possible; this is the second goal of the strategy. The final goal of the strategy is the study of disks around stars, important both to understand the implications of the variety of exoplanet systems for planet formation, and to determine how many nearby stars have environments around them clean enough of debris that planets may be sought and, if found, characterized.},

abstract = {The NASA TESS mission will deliver hundreds of transiting exoplanet candidates orbiting bright stars. The spectrometers SOPHIE at OHP and SPIRou at CFHT will be ideal to obtain radial velocities of these candidates, confirm their nature, and derive the planets' masses. These measurements will be crucial to deliver the best targets for atmospheric characterization with JWST. Here, we calculate the required observing time with SOPHIE, SPIRou, and JWST for each of the TESS targets in order to prepare follow-up observations. To infer their potential for JWST, we restrict the calculations to the case of transmission spectroscopy with NIRISS. The radial velocity follow-up of the giant planets ({\$}R{\_}p {\textgreater} 4 \backslashrm \backslash, R{\_}E{\$}) could be achieved with SOPHIE, with a median observing time of 3.47 hours per target, and a total observing time of 305 hours that includes the 80{\%} most favorable cases. Several small planets ({\$}R{\_}p {\textless} 4 \backslashrm \backslash, R{\_}E{\$}) could also be confirmed, but most of them would require an unrealistic time investment. On the other hand, SPIRou is ideally suited to the follow-up of the small planets, with a median observing time of 2.65 hours per target, and a median observing time of 4.70 hours for the terrestrial planets in the habitable zone ({\$}R{\_}p {\textless} 2 \backslashrm \backslash, R{\_}E{\$}, {\$}S {\textless} 2 \backslashrm \backslash, S{\_}E{\$}). With JWST, the 10{\%} most favorable small planets (184 planets) have a median observing time of 16.2 hours, and the 10{\%} most favorable habitable zone terrestrial planets (7 planets) have a median observing time of 59.7 hours. Overall, this study will help define a follow-up strategy and prepare observation programs with SOPHIE and SPIRou before the first planet candidates are delivered by TESS.},

This star undergoes periodic variations in radial velocity which is attributed here to orbital motion resulting from the presence of an unseen companion. The rather short period of 84 days places the companion in an orbit similar to that of Mercury around the sun, whereas the rather low velocity amplitude of about 0.6 km/s implies that the mass of the companion may be as low as 0.011 solar mass, or 11 Jupiter masses. This leads to the suggestion that the companion is probably a brown dwarf, and may even be a giant planet. However, because the inclination of the orbit to the line of sight is unknown, the mass of the companion may be considerably larger than this lower limit.},

This second planet, HD 37605c, has a period of {\~{}}7.5 years with a low eccentricity and an Msini of {\~{}}3.4 MJup. Our discovery was made with the nearly 8 years of radial velocity follow-up at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope and Keck Observatory, including observations made as part of the Transit Ephemeris Refinement and Monitoring Survey (TERMS) effort to provide precise ephemerides to long-period planets for transit follow-up. With a total of 137 radial velocity observations covering almost eight years, we provide a good orbital solution of the HD 37605 system, and a precise transit ephemeris for HD 37605b. Our dynamic analysis reveals very minimal planet-planet interaction and an insignificant transit time variation. Using the predicted ephemeris, we performed a transit search for HD 37605b with the photometric data taken by the T12 0.8-m Automatic Photoelectric Telescope (APT) and the Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars (MOST) satellite. Though the APT photometry did not capture the transit window, it characterized the stellar activity of HD 37605, which is consistent of it being an old, inactive star, with a tentative rotation period of 57.67 days. The MOST photometry enabled us to report a dispositive null detection of a non-grazing transit for this planet. Within the predicted transit window, we exclude an edge-on predicted depth of 1.9{\%} at {\textgreater}{\textgreater}10sigma, and exclude any transit with an impact parameter b{\textgreater}0.951 at greater than 5sigma. We present the BOOTTRAN package for calculating Keplerian orbital parameter uncertainties via bootstrapping.

abstract = {Asteroseismology provides us with a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. Recent developments, including the first systematic studies of solar-like pulsators, have boosted the impact of this field of research within astrophysics and have led to a significant increase in the size of the research community. In the present paper we start by reviewing the basic observational and theoretical properties of classical and solar-like pulsators and present results from some of the most recent and outstanding studies of these stars. We centre our review on those classes of pulsators for which interferometric studies are expected to provide a significant input. We discuss current limitations to asteroseismic studies, including difficulties in mode identification and in the accurate determination of global parameters of pulsating stars, and, after a brief review of those aspects of interferometry that are most relevant in this context, anticipate how interferometric observations may contribute to overcome these limitations. Moreover, we present results of recent pilot studies of pulsating stars involving both asteroseismic and interferometric constraints and look into the future, summarizing ongoing efforts concerning the development of future instruments and satellite missions which are expected to have an impact in this field of research.},

New insights on stellar evolution and stellar interiors physics are being made possible by asteroseismology, the study of stars by the observation of natural, resonant oscillations. Asteroseismology is proving to be particularly significant for the study of solar-type and red-giant stars. These stars show rich spectra of solar-like oscillations, which are excited and intrinsically damped by turbulence in the outermost layers of the convective envelopes. In this review we discuss the current state of the field, with a particular emphasis on recent advances provided by the Kepler and CoRoT space missions and the wider significance to astronomy of the results from asteroseismology, such as stellar populations studies and exoplanet studies.},

abstract = {The Ancient Egyptians wrote Calendars of Lucky and Unlucky Days that assigned astronomically influenced prognoses for each day of the year. The best preserved of these calendars is the Cairo Calendar (hereafter CC) dated to 1244–1163 B.C. We have presented evidence that the 2.85 days period in the lucky prognoses of CC is equal to that of the eclipsing binary Algol during this historical era. We wanted to find out the vocabulary that represents Algol in the mythological texts of CC. Here we show that Algol was represented as Horus and thus signified both divinity and kingship. The texts describing the actions of Horus are consistent with the course of events witnessed by any naked eye observer of Algol. These descriptions support our claim that CC is the oldest preserved historical document of the discovery of a variable star. The period of the Moon, 29.6 days, has also been discovered in CC. We show that the actions of Seth were connected to this period, which also strongly regulated the times described as lucky for Heaven and for Earth. Now, for the first time, periodicity is discovered in the descriptions of the days in CC. Unlike many previous attempts to uncover the reasoning behind the myths of individual days, we discover the actual rules in the appearance and behaviour of deities during the whole year... “In 1596, Fabricius discovered the first variable star, Mira. Holwarda determined its eleven month period 44 years later. In 1669, Montanari discovered the second variable star, Algol. Goodricke determined the 2.867 days period of Algol in 1783,” Jetsu and Porceddu said. “All these astronomical discoveries were made with naked eye. Since then, they have become milestones of natural sciences... Our statistical analysis of the Cairo Calendar confirms that all these milestones should be shifted about three millennia backwards in time,” the scientists concluded.},

abstract = {We calculate the dynamical tides raised on a nonrotating solar-type star by a close stellar or planetary companion. Dissipation arising from a turbulent viscosity operating in the convection zone and radiative damping in the radiative core are considered. We compute the torque exerted on the star by a companion in circular orbit and determine the potentially observable magnitude of the tidally induced velocity at the stellar photosphere. These calculations are compared to the results obtained by assuming that a very small frequency limit can be taken in order to calculate the tidal response (equilibrium tide). For a standard solar model the latter is found to give a relatively poor approximation at the periods of interest of several days, even when the system is far from resonance with a normal mode. This behavior is caused by the small value of the Brunt-V{\"{a}}is{\"{a}}l{\"{a}} frequency in the interior regions of the convection zone. It is shown that although the companion may go through a succession of resonances as it spirals in under the action of the tides, for a fixed spectrum of normal modes its migration is controlled essentially by the nonresonant interaction. We find that the turbulent viscosity that is required to provide the observed circularization rates of main-sequence solar-type binaries is about 50 times larger than that simply estimated from mixing-length theory for nonrotating stars. We discuss the means by which this enhanced viscosity might be realized. These calculations are applied to 51 Pegasi. We show that the perturbed velocity induced by the tides at the stellar surface is too small to be observed. This result is insensitive to the magnitude of the turbulent viscosity assumed and is not affected by the possibility of resonance. For this system the stellar rotation and the orbital motion are expected to be synchronized if the mass of the companion is as much as 1/10 M⊙.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In the light of recent significant progress on both the observational and theoretical fronts, we review the status of white dwarf stars as cosmochronometers. These objects represent the end products of stellar evolution for the vast majority of stars and, as such, can be used to constrain the ages of various populations of evolved stars in the Galaxy. For example, the oldest white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (the remnants of the very first generation of intermediate‐mass stars in the Galactic disk) are still visible and can be used, in conjunction with cooling theory, to estimate the age of the disk. More recent observations suggest the tantalizing possibility that a population of very old white dwarfs inhabits the Galactic halo. Such a population may contribute significantly to baryonic “dark” matter in the Milky Way and may be used to obtain an independent estimate of the age of the halo. In addition, white dwarf cosmochronology is likely to play a very significant role in the coming era o...},

abstract = {A hot Jupiter transiting a m V = 7.6 A-star. ABSTRACT In this paper we present MASCARA-2 b, a hot Jupiter transiting the m V = 7.6 A2 star HD 185603. It is the second planet discovered with the Multi-site All-Sky CAmeRA (MASCARA), which is specifically designed to find the brightest transiting planetary systems in the sky (m V {\textless} 8.4). Since early 2015, the northern station has taken more than 1.6 million flux measurements of the star, corre-sponding to a total of almost 3000 hours of observations, revealing it transits every 3.474135 ± 0.00001 days with a depth of 1.4{\%}. Photometric follow-up observations with the NITES and IAC80 telescopes were used to confirm the transits. We obtained spectro-scopic measurements with the SONG telescope to characterize the host star and to measure the radial velocities induced by the planet. In addition we observed two transits spectroscopically to measure the obliquity. The planet has a radius of 2.2 +0.5 −0.3 R J and a 99{\%} upper limit on the mass of {\textless} 15 M J . Contrary to most other hot Jupiters transiting early-type stars, the projected planet orbital axis and stellar spin axis are found to be aligned. We expect MASCARA to reveal many more bright transiting systems. Of the fourteen transiting planetary systems with m V {\textless} 8.4 known to date only two are located in the southern hemisphere. A second MASCARA station at the European Southern Observatory at La Silla, Chile, will start operations from July 2017 to unveil this planet population in the southern hemisphere.},

A general description of nonradial stellar oscillations is given on the basis of linear adiabatic theory, and nonradial oscillations of spherical stars without rotation, magnetic fields, or other 'perturbations' are considered. Some effects of rotation, magnetic fields, thermal imbalance, and convection on nonradial stellar oscillations are briefly discussed. Recent applications of stellar oscillation theory to actual stars are summarized, including applications to rapid blue variables, the sun, lower main-sequence stars, Beta Cephei stars, and models representing classical Cepheids, RR Lyrae variables, and Delta Scuti variables. Possible improvements in the theory of nonradial stellar oscillations are noted.},

@article{Quataert1995,
abstract = {We check the validity of the widely used classical apsidal motion formula as a function of orbital parameters, stellar structure, and stellar rotation rate by comparing dynamical calculations of the periastron advance with the static tidal formula. We find that the classical formula gives very accurate results when the periods of the low order quadrupole g, f and p modes are smaller than the periastron passage time by a factor of about 7 or more. However, when this condition is not satisfied, the difference between the classical formula and the exact result can be quite large, and even periastron recession can result. The largest difference arises when one of the low order modes of the star is nearly resonant with an integer multiple of the orbital frequency minus twice the rotation rate of the star. The resonance of higher order g-modes (number of radial nodes gta 4) with the orbit is very unlikely to cause significant deviation from the classical result because of their weak coupling to the tidal force and thus their small contribution to the apsidal motion. Resonances involving rotational modes of the star are also unlikely to make much contribution to the apsidal motion because of their small overlap with the tidal force, even though they have periods comparable to the periastron passage time. We apply our work to two famous binary systems (AS Cam and DI Her) which show abnormally small apsidal motion, and conclude that dynamical effects are unimportant for these systems, i.e. the static tide assumption is an excellent approximation.},

abstract = {Close-in, massive exoplanets raise significant tides in their stellar hosts. We compute the radial velocity (RV) signal due to this fluid motion in the equilibrium tide approximation. The predicted radial velocities in the observed sample of exoplanets exceed 1 m/s for 17 systems, with the largest predicted signal being {\~{}}30 m/s for WASP-18 b. Tidally-induced RV's are thus detectable with present methods. Both tidal fluid flow and the epicyclic motion of a slightly eccentric orbit produce an RV signal at twice the orbital frequency. If care is not taken, the tidally induced RV may, in some cases, be confused with a finite orbital eccentricity. Indeed, WASP-18 b is reported to have an eccentric orbit with small e=0.009 and pericenter longitude $\backslash$omega=-$\backslash$pi/2. Whereas such a close alignment of the orbit and line of sight to the observer requires fine tuning, this phase in the RV signal is naturally explained by the tidal velocity signature of an e=0 orbit. Additionally, the equilibrium tide estimate for the amplitude is in rough agreement with the data. Thus the reported eccentricity for WASP-18 b is instead likely a signature of the tidally-induced RV in the stellar host. Measurement of both the orbital and tidal velocity for non-transiting planets may allow planet mass and inclination to be separately determined solely from radial velocity data. We suggest that high precision fitting of RV data should include the tidal velocity signal in those cases where it may affect the determination of orbital parameters.},

@article{Burkart2012,
abstract = {We develop a general framework for interpreting and analyzing high-precision lightcurves from eccentric stellar binaries. Although our methods are general, we focus on the recently discovered Kepler system KOI-54, a face-on binary of two A stars with {\$}e=0.83{\$} and an orbital period of 42 days. KOI-54 exhibits strong ellipsoidal variability during its periastron passage; its lightcurve also contains {\~{}}20 pulsations at perfect harmonics of the orbital frequency, and another {\~{}}10 nonharmonic pulsations. Analysis of such data is a new form of asteroseismology in which oscillation amplitudes and phases rather than frequencies contain information that can be mined to constrain stellar properties. We qualitatively explain the physics of mode excitation and the range of harmonics expected to be observed. To quantitatively model observed pulsation spectra, we develop and apply a linear, tidally forced, nonadiabatic stellar oscillation formalism including the Coriolis force. We produce temporal power spectra for KOI-54 that are semi-quantitatively consistent with the observations. Both stars in the KOI-54 system are expected to be rotating pseudosynchronously, with resonant nonaxisymmetric modes providing a key contribution to the total torque; such resonances provide a possible explanation for the two largest-amplitude harmonic pulsations observed in KOI-54, although we find quantitative problems with this interpretation. We show in detail that the nonharmonic pulsations observed in KOI-54 can be produced by nonlinear three-mode coupling. The methods developed in this paper can be generalized in the future to determine the best-fit stellar parameters given pulsation data. We also derive an analytic model of KOI-54's ellipsoidal variability, including both tidal distortion and stellar irradiation, which can be used to model other similar systems.},

@article{Terquem1998a,
abstract = {We calculate the dynamical tides raised on a non-rotating solar-type star by a close stellar or planetary companion. Dissipation arising from a turbulent viscosity operating in the convection zone and radiative damping in the radiative core are considered. We compute the torque exerted on the star by a companion in circular orbit, and determine the potentially observable magnitude of the tidally induced velocity at the stellar photosphere. These calculations are compared with the results obtained by assuming that a very small frequency limit can be taken in order to calculate the tidal response (equilibrium tide). For a standard solar model, the latter is found to give a relatively poor approximation at the periods of interest of several days, even when the system is far from resonance with a normal mode. It is shown that although the companion may go through a succession of resonances as it spirals in under the action of the tides, for a fixed spectrum of normal modes its migration is controlled essentially by the non-resonant interaction. We find that the turbulent viscosity that is required to provide the observed circularization rates of main sequence solar-type binaries is about fifty times larger than that simply estimated from mixing length theory for non-rotating stars. We discuss the means by which this enhanced viscosity might be realized. These calculations are applied to 51 Pegasi. We show that the perturbed velocity induced by the tides at the stellar surface is too small to be observed.},

MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates " on-the-fly " from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESAʼs development.},

abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar. Improvements in MESAstar's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESAstar. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESAstar calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3–8 M stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESAstar solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESAstar results.},

Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) is a suite of open source, robust, efficient, thread-safe libraries for a wide range of applications in computational stellar astrophysics. A one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESA star, combines many of the numerical and physics modules for simulations of a wide range of stellar evolution scenarios ranging from very low mass to massive stars, including advanced evolutionary phases. MESA star solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. State-of-the-art modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, element diffusion data, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own explicitly defined public interface to facilitate independent development. Several detailed examples indicate the extensive verification and testing that is continuously performed and demonstrate the wide range of capabilities that MESA possesses. These examples include evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets to very old ages; the complete evolutionary track of a 1 M star from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to a cooling white dwarf; the solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate-mass stars through the He-core burning phase and thermal pulses on the He-shell burning asymptotic giant branch phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; the complete evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the PMS to the onset of core collapse; mass transfer from stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and the evolution of helium accretion onto a neutron star.
